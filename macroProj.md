The Macro project was my final project for Java Data Structures. The goal of the project was to allow the user to record all inputs into a computer, including things such as mouse movements, dragging, mouse clicks, key presses, scrolling, and delays. Those actions should then be stored or logged. The actions can then be replayed exactly as they were recorded.
